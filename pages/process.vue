        The design thinking process are the guidelines I follow during the
        creation of a new solution. Adapting these steps to each different
        project and given requirements helps me to find the right solution. Here
        you can have a look at my approach of different phases and
        methodologies.

          The most perfect design will be never good enough if there is no
          alignment between design and implementation. As part of the process, I
          have always worked in constant interaction with the devs team in order
          to verify and help with the best implementation of the solution.
