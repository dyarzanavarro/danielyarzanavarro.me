        I also served as the product owner for several frontend applications,
        including a legacy application and a new Angular team. My focus was on
        driving transformation and operational excellence for these

        and business teams to establish clear goals and objectives, as well as
        facilitating communication and collaboration to ensure the successful

        As a product owner at Yallo & Lebara, my purpose was to drive the

            team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping UX as a priority throughout the development process, by
            collaborating closely with the UX team to ensure that designs and
            prototypes met the needs of end-users.

        existing team members on the new stack. I had to manage dependencies
        between different parts of the project, which could be challenging,
        depending on the size of the team and the complexity of the project. I
        had to keep the team motivated throughout the development process,
        especially if things didn't go as planned or if delays occurred, to
        ensure that the project stayed on track. I had to make difficult
        trade-offs and prioritize different aspects of the project to ensure
        that the most important features and functionalities were completed on
        time and on budget.
